# Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

This repository covers various concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript. The main concepts covered in the `index.js` file include:

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation involves combining a group of related variables and functions into a single unit, referred to as an object. This promotes better organization and structure in your code. The `employee` example in the code showcases encapsulation.

## Abstraction

Abstraction is a concept that hides unnecessary details and exposes only essential information. It simplifies user interaction by providing a clean and understandable interface. The car and car showroom examples in the code demonstrate abstraction.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a programming pillar that allows the reuse of code by referencing the behavior and data of another object. The `Person` and `Employee` classes showcase inheritance in JavaScript.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a technique that allows a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms. The code demonstrates polymorphic behavior through the `Animal`, `Dog`, and `Cat` classes.

## Upcoming Topics

The repository will be updated to cover additional OOP concepts, including:

-Pillars of Oops
- Object Literals
- Factories
- Constructors
- Constructor Property
- Functions are Objects
- Value vs Reference Types
- Adding or Removing Properties
- Enumerating Properties
- Private Properties and Methods
- Getters and Setters

Stay tuned for more updates as these topics are covered in the upcoming commits.

Feel free to explore the code in `index.js` for examples and explanations of each OOP concept.

Happy coding!
